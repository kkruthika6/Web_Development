        <div>
        <p>Working at Mercedes-Benz Research & Development India, initially as an intern and later as a trainee, I
            got intrigued by the concept of using User Experience Design (UX) and User Interface (UI) for user
            satisfaction through a quick and efficient working website. I also witnessed how this idea could drive
            businesses to great heights. Utilizing these innovative and problem-solving skills, my interest gradually
            inclined towards the field of data and information. To continue my conquest in gaining expertise over
            information technology, which will not only build on my strong programming but also enhance my
            business acumen and equip me with the latest technologies and software competencies sought after by
            competitive companies, I have decided to pursue my Master of Science in Information Systems, which will
            help me to ensure a seamless transition of the technology in furthering business efforts.
        </p>

            Pursuing Bachelor’s in Computer Science Engineering at KLE Technological University (August 2017 to July
            2021), I studied the subjects Data Structures and Analytics, Database Management Systems, Machine
            Learning, Data Mining and Analysis, Information Security and Web Technologies.

            While I was still in my undergraduate program, I realized the enormous potential for research as I worked
            on many academic projects,through which I used knowledge gained in the classroom and workshopsfor
            practical application. One of the projects, I worked was on ‘Pre-Training Quantization of DNNs for Model
            Compression’ in sixth semester and in a team of 5. The objective of the project was to quantize a 32-bit
            model to an 8-bit model during training to optimize inference on edge devices. Being successful on new
            approach, I received a lot of appreciation from the Head of the Department which pushed me learn more
            about Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I also published a research paper on the same in International
            Symposium on Signal Processing and Intelligent Recognition Systems, Springer, Singapore, 2020. Few of
            my other projects were based on data mining, web development, and networking. I also channelized my
            interest in Computer programming and Computer engineering applications. With the mindset of learning
            more, I also took up some courses in Coursera on web development, deep learning, networking, and cloud
            computing. Later, I attended a workshop on ethical hacking and further decided to learn and certify as
            Juniper Networks Certified Associate (JNCIA-Junos) with an interest in networking.
            In eighth semester, I interned for 5 months (March 2021 to July 2021) at Mercedes-Benz Research and
            Development, India, where I got hands-on with React Javascript and Typescript technologies. I am
            currently working as a Graduate Engineer Trainee, designated as UI developer at Mercedes-Benz Research
            and Development, India. As a part of my training, I have learnt HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React,
            Angular, and concepts of Project Management and got specifically trained on front-end development. In
            my role as a UI developer in the development team, I am working on developing internal web applications,
            mainly using react and typescript. My interest in web development has ameliorated since I joined this
            prestigious organization and I now desire to develop skills in information studies.

            The pervasive nature of computer technologies and the constant demand for newer and sophisticated
            tools, devices, and software applications in the field have only fueledmy determination to delve deeper
            into the field of Data Analysis and Information Systems.
